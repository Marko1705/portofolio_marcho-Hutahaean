                    <p><b><span class="h2">Introduction</span></b><br>Games are among the applications popular with the
                        public, as supported by research conducted by MoboMarket. Many games are created merely to
                        entertain students, which partly explains why high school students often lack interest in
                        studying mathematics. Two main factors contribute to this lack of interest: the first is
                        internal, where students have a low curiosity or enjoyment in learning math, and the second is
                        external, where they feel bored and uninterested in doing calculations<span id="dots"
                            style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><span id="more"> This study aims to develop an
                            interactive mathematics quiz game application based on WebGL and created using Unity 2D, as
                            a solution to help shift students' perceptions that mathematics is complicated and
                            difficult. The application includes various features such as sound effects, back, open,
                            info, quit, and answer buttons. By leveraging Unity 2D technology, the game is built for
                            WebGL, allowing it to run directly in a web browser.
                            <br><b><span class="h2">THEORETICAL BASIS</span></b><br>
                            Definition of GameA game, derived from the English word "game," refers to an activity of
                            play that simulates real-life situations but remains fictional. A game provides an
                            environment (or atmosphere) that facilitates learning, enhancing students' skills.(Sandy,
                            2020) Games are usually played for entertainment while simultaneously serving as educational
                            tools.MathematicsMathematics is a subject introduced at the elementary school level and
                            encountered in daily life.(Kaurie, Purwanto and Minarni, 2020) Therefore, the importance of
                            mathematics for students, particularly those in high school, lies in helping them understand
                            and solve problems. Mathematics is a subject that enhances intelligence by utilizing logic
                            for calculations, making logic the foundation for mathematics development.WebGLWebGL is a
                            JavaScript-based wrapper for OpenGL and is one of the game-building tools used in Unity for
                            web browser-based applications. WebGL is commonly used to design 3D games and web-based
                            websites.(Azis Abdul dkk., 2021)Unity HubUnity Hub is an application that facilitates the
                            discovery, downloading, and management of Unity projects and installations.(Ramadhani,
                            Sundari and Khairunnisa, 2024) It also provides Unity templates, simplifying the process for
                            developers to download, install, and manage various versions of the Unity editor in one
                            place.Visual Studio CodeVisual Studio Code is an open-source editor provided by Unity for
                            coding and editing. Being open-source means it can be used free of charge. This application
                            supports various programming languages, including JavaScript, PHP, Python, and
                            others.(Sandfreni, Ulum and Azizah, 2021)Unity 2DUnity 2D is a tool used to create 2D
                            graphics in video games. It enables game development across various platforms, including
                            iOS, Android, Windows, and consoles such as PlayStation, Xbox, iPad, and iPhone. Unity 2D
                            also supports browser-based games designed with the Unity web player plugin, which works on
                            Mac and Windows but not Linux. Unity supports the creationof both 2D and 3D games, offering
                            a diverse range of object graphics, from simple 2D designs to complex 3D models. (Baskoro
                            and Ariadi, 2023)C# Programming LanguageC# (pronounced C-sharp) is a programming language
                            used to create applications or games. With C#, programmers can develop and design web
                            applications or games. It is commonly used with Visual Studio to support programmers in
                            their work. C# is designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), enabling the
                            runtime environment to operate across platforms or devices, such as computers with different
                            architectures, without needing to rewrite the code. C# is a programming language developed
                            by Microsoft that operates on the .NET Framework.(Syahnita, 2021)UML(Sinaga, 2019)The
                            Unified Modeling Language (UML) issued by the Object Management Group (OMG), is a graphic
                            language and has been widely accepted as a standard method for modeling object oriented
                            software systems. This can also be applied to modeling business process and system
                            architecture and hardware design. (Nasyiah, 2022) For the system design required in the
                            development of this math quiz game, the UML diagrams used include Sequence Diagram, Use
                            Case, and Activity
                            Diagram. Below are their explanations:Sequence DiagramA sequence diagram illustrates how the
                            system responds to user activities. (Rizal Munadi et al., 2023) It also displays messages or
                            commands given along with their execution times.Use Case DiagramA use case diagram isa
                            technique for capturing the functionality of a system. A use case de-scribes the typical
                            interactions between the system's users and the system itself by providing a narrative of
                            how the system is used. The features within the system can be utilized to help cate-gorize
                            the system, which UML uses to illustrate how actors interact with the system (Maidiana,
                            2021).Activity DiagramAn activity diagram is one type of diagram in UML that can model the
                            various processes occur-ring within a system (Menora et al., 2023).
                            <br><b><span class="h2">METODE</span></b><br>
                            Data Collection MethodsAt this stage, the methods used are questionnaires and surveys. To
                            collect data, the author pro-vides a series of questions to students. The questionnaire
                            questions given by the author are as follows:1.What causes students to feel bored while
                            learning mathematics?2.What habits do students adopt to overcome boredom during
                            learning?3.What kind of gaming experience do students have at school?In the final stage, the
                            author will conduct a survey using these three questions to obtain survey results that will
                            facilitate the development of a mathematics quiz game, making it easier to cre-ate.Software
                            Development MethodologyThe system or software development in this research aims to outline
                            the steps involved in the game development process. For the development of this quiz game,
                            the methodology used is the Game Development Life Cycle (GDLC). GDLC is an iterative
                            approach to game development that consists of six phases: initialization/concept creation,
                            pre-production,production, testing, beta, and release. However, in the development of this
                            mathematics quiz game application, only a few phases of the GDLC methodology are applied, as
                            described below:1.Initialization/Concept CreationThis is the initial step in developing the
                            mathematics quiz game, which involves creating the concept of the quiz game to be developed.
                            The quiz will take the form of essay questions, and the developer, Marcho Malona Hutahaean,
                            will identify the elements to be added to the game.2.ProductionIn this phase, new assets are
                            created for the game development. These assets include:oImage folder: To enhance the game's
                            visual appeal.oScript folder: To ensure the game is functional and playable.oSound folder:
                            To add audio features that make the game more engaging.oAnimation folder: To include minor
                            animations, such as text animations, in the quiz game.These organized resources facilitate
                            the production process and simplify the de-velopment of the mathematics quiz
                            game.3.TestingIn this stage, operational testing is conducted to determine whether the game
                            is ready for use. Playtesting is carried out to assess the functionality of game features
                            and ensure that all components work as intended. This phase is performed by the
                            developer.4.Beta TestingThis development phase involves external testing by third parties,
                            such as high school students or game testers enlisted by the developer. They are tasked with
                            identifying bugs or issues related to the features within the
                            application.5.ReleaseVersionThis is the final phase of development, where the game is
                            prepared for release and made available to high school students as a WebGL-based
                            application.

                            <br><b><span class="h2">DISCUSSION</span></b><br>
                            In developing this math quiz game, the GDLC method was used to make the game development
                            process more structured. The game was designed using the UML method to facilitate the
                            developers in designing the structure of the quiz game, which includes multiple playable
                            levels to increase high school students' interest in learning math.<br>
                            System testing will be conducted using the alpha testing method to identify any bugs or
                            non-functional features within the math quiz game when it is being played.
                            <br><b><span class="h2">Conclusion</span></b><br>
                            The following are the conclusions of this research. Developing a math quiz game application
